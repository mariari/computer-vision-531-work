The only interesting assignments from a code perspective is Assignment1 and Assignment2.

The code is explained via org-mode notebooks/pdfs in the doc folder of each assignment

Assignment3 just has code from the dependently typed neural net gernade
Assignment4 has a few interesting functions but overall is unfinished
Assignment5 are just explanations.
